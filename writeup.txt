The Namesake
------------

Our spimbot is named Tracer, namely it can trace the setpoint on the map and move to a target.

--------------------------
Strategies and Optimizaion
--------------------------
  Kernal Detection:
        Tracer can spirally dectect the kernal from near to far in 8x8 grid.
        Originally, we dectect the target using row traversal, 
        which will potentially cause Trace to move to a futher targert instead of the nearest one.
  
  Basic Movementï¼š
        In the very first few cycle, we hard code the Tracer to make it enter the central part of the ear map
        where it has less chance to bonk on wall. Then Tracer find targets using its spiral dectection.
  
  Bonking:
        Tracer will never bonk a wall. Tracer can track the setpoints on the map.
        Mostly, setpoints are inside the "corridors" and some speical space where Tracer are likely to bonk on wall.
        So setpoints are the grids where Tracer can advance or withdraw.

  Move to a Target:
        Usually, when there is no barracide between Tracer and the nearest targert, it can move directly to the target.
        However, in some cases, there is a wall between. We can let it bonk the wall and wait for the next nearest target occurs.
        But it leads to a random, unperdictable result. And this cycle penalty is much more than find a solution.
